<h1>Lilah's Pitches!</h1>
<div class="post">
	<h2>Pitch 1: How Gun-Rights Lobbyist Spending influences Congressional Voting</h2>
	<p>I'd like to create an interactive that directly compares political spending by the NRA and other gun rights lobbyists with congressional voting records. No current interactives on the topic make this distinction clear.</p>
	<p>A few potential data sources for this project are the congressional voting records dataset at <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/support/Congressional+Voting+Records" target="blank">UCI's Machine Learning Repository </a> and OpenSecrets's <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=Q13&cycle=2012&recipdetail=H&mem=Y" target="blank"> Gun Rights: Money to Congress</a> data.</p>
	<p>I will have to speak to a few human sources to learn where the hidden money is, however (via Super Pacs, etc), as these numbers seem signifiantly lower than is accurate. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/magazine/inside-the-power-of-the-nra.html?pagewanted=all" target="blank">this article</a>, Robert Draper at the NYT notes that the NRA spent more than $345,000 on the campaign of Jeff Flake of Arizona last year. But Flake only has $26,250 recorded on OpenSecrets. I would like to speak with Draper, as well as the two sources you suggested (Derek Willis and Lena Groeger) to figure out how to track down the most accurate data. If this is difficult to do, I may change my direction a bit and focus on creating a visualization that depicts the different ways gun rights lobbyists can influence voters, but keep it simple: I imagine it as a circle, with different sides pointing to the different methods they use: attack ads, direct campaign spending, email campaigns to their members encouraging them to pressure their representatives, etc.</p>
	<p>I may have to learn how to scrape a site for Super Pac donations, and organize all that data in one place. Once I get the data, I'll also have to learn how to write the code needed to format a visualization that could take on a look like <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/guns/#bill1" target="blank">this.</a></p>
	<p>I could pitch this idea to a variety of publications: ProPublica, which has an ongoing Guns topic open, as well as Slate, which did a similar <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2013/01/map_the_gun_lobby_s_campaign_contributions_by_congressional_district.html" target="blank">gun lobby donations by representative map.</a> It seems they used similarly low numbers, so they may be interested in a more accurate visualization. Mother Jones is another publication that may find this information on par with their mission.</p>

	<h2>Pitch 2: The average salaries of different NYC city workers, by occupation</h2>
	<p>I recently spoke to an NYC sanitation worker and found out he makes $85k a year and can start collecting his pension after 20 years. Wow! This made me want to take a look at the occupational wages of other city employees, and compare them.</p>
	<p>There is substantial data available for this: <a href="http://seethroughny.net/payrolls/city-of-ny/" target="blank">SeeThroughNY</a>, a project from the Manhattan Institute's Empire Center for New York State Policy, hosts this data for 2009-2012. The <a href="http://labor.ny.gov/stats/lswage2.asp" target="blank">Department of Labor</a> also collects this data for NYC and all of New York State.</p>
	<p>I'm not sure I would need any human sources for this one, as all the data is easily accessible.</p>
	<p>I will need to figure out how to scrape this data off the site (there's no direct "download" button), then organize the data. The data available is for every individual city employee (I could even look up the sanitation worker I spoke with by name and see his salary!). Would I find the average total pay for each position, then choose the positions I'd like to map, then place it all on a chart? I'd also like to learn more about the different charts I could potentially make and the best tools to make them.</p>
	<p>I could pitch this idea to many different NYC publications: New York Magazine, WNYC, The New York Times, etc.</p>

	<h2>Pitch 3: How many placements do foster kids in Massachusetts really go through?</h2>
	<p>This one may be a stretch, but I'd like to find and visualize more accurate data on the number of placements for each kid in the foster system. I want to start with Massachusetts, where the Department of Child Services (DCF) has been facing a lot of pressure, but if the data can be retrieved on a broader scale, I could expland to other states or nationally. The problem is, the data available is skewed: when children are moved, often their number gets defaulted back to zero. So I'd like to get a more raw version of that data, and if I'm successful, configure it into a graphic of some kind.</p>
	<p>Data sources that are available come from the <a href="http://www.casey.org/Newsroom/MediaKit/pdf/FosterCareByTheNumbers.pdf" target="blank">Casey Foundation</a>, the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, the Administration for Children and Families, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Again, these numbers are all likely innacurate, because the states report their information to these federal agencies, so if the states don't report the accurate information, the report will be wrong.</p>
	<p>I have the contact info for a social worker in DCF and someone at the State House that I plan to call to request the data for every input of a child into a foster home over the past (ideally) 18 years, with either a name or an anonymous ID number, as well as dates, and the dates of release. </p>
	<p>I will need to learn the most sensitive ways to request data of this kind. If I do receive the data, I'll need to learn how to chart that information in the clearest way.</p>
	<p>I could pitch this completed project to a number of MA organizations. Most notably, Boston's NPR branch, WBUR, and the Boston Globe. Both report regularly on DCF and foster care.</p>
